        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>Due to high interest in creativity,I started working in this field in my early college days.Overtime, getting experience in Android App Development and Web Designing.</p>
      <h4> Seek out additional opportunities for growth </h4>
		<p> In high school, having a high GPA defined success (more or less). That changes tremendously in college. I’m not saying that grades aren’t important, but I am saying that other parts of life will come into play.Learning soft skills such as communication (by communication, I don’t just mean having the ability to talk to the opposite gender) will greatly expand your network of influential people. Speaking of networks, having a group of influential people around will help you greatly in your future. See what I mean? It’s no longer just about the grades; it’s also about your reputation as a hard worker, your ability to sweet-talk an interviewer, and your desire to improve yourself.</p>
		<h5> Have fun but don’t make choices you will regret. </h5>
		<p> Going crazy after leaving home (forever) is part of the first-year experience. But don’t go too crazy. Remember, you only have a few years at a university, so be sure to make the most out of them. I’m not telling you not to have fun – by all means, your first year of college life is when you’re supposed to go crazy – but don’t make choices you’ll regret. There are a lot of opportunities, people to meet, and most of all, distance to grow; it’d be a shame to waste four years throwing ping pong balls around in a basement. </p>
